This comes out of regressing the equation determining T*(t) on data from Robinson et al. (2012). Should be used with tmaxa=3.4 only. Nordhaus also carries out sensitivity analysis with double melt rate but says this is beyond any reported estimates in AR5. Note low and high scenarios defined as 2.5% and 97.5% of distribution.
